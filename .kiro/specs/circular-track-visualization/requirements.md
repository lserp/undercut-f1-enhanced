# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a new visualization that represents the F1 track as a circular display where each driver's position is shown as a dot on the circle. As drivers complete laps in real life, their corresponding dots revolve around the circle, providing an intuitive and visually appealing way to track driver positions and relative gaps during a race or qualifying session. The visualization updates in real-time based on timing data from the F1 live timing system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user watching F1 timing data, I want to see a circular track visualization where each driver is represented as a dot on a circle, so that I can intuitively understand driver positions and track progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the circular track visualization is displayed THEN the system SHALL render a circle representing the track layout
2. WHEN timing data is available THEN the system SHALL display each driver as a distinct dot positioned on the circle
3. WHEN a driver completes distance on track THEN the system SHALL move their corresponding dot around the circle proportionally
4. WHEN multiple drivers are on track THEN the system SHALL display all active drivers simultaneously on the circle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user monitoring race progress, I want driver dots to move around the circle based on real timing data, so that I can see live track positions and relative gaps between drivers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN timing data updates are received THEN the system SHALL recalculate each driver's position on the circle
2. WHEN a driver crosses the start/finish line THEN the system SHALL complete a full revolution for that driver's dot
3. WHEN drivers have different lap progress THEN the system SHALL position dots at different points around the circle
4. WHEN timing data indicates sector times THEN the system SHALL use this data to interpolate positions between timing points

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing the circular track, I want each driver to be visually distinguishable, so that I can easily identify and track specific drivers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying driver dots THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors for each driver
2. WHEN a driver dot is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the driver's number or identifier
3. WHEN multiple drivers are close together THEN the system SHALL ensure visual separation to prevent overlap
4. WHEN driver colors are assigned THEN the system SHALL use consistent team colors where available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user switching between different displays, I want to access the circular track visualization through the existing navigation system, so that I can easily switch to this view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses a designated key THEN the system SHALL switch to the circular track visualization
2. WHEN in circular track mode THEN the system SHALL display the visualization with appropriate headers and labels
3. WHEN switching away from circular track mode THEN the system SHALL return to the previous display
4. WHEN the circular track display is active THEN the system SHALL show relevant session information and timing data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing the circular track during different session types, I want the visualization to work appropriately for practice, qualifying, and race sessions, so that I can use it throughout different F1 session types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in a race session THEN the system SHALL show all drivers' current lap positions
2. WHEN in a qualifying session THEN the system SHALL show drivers' positions during their current flying laps
3. WHEN drivers are in different laps THEN the system SHALL handle multi-lap scenarios appropriately
4. WHEN session data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message or fallback state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing the circular track, I want to see additional context information, so that I can understand the current session state and driver status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the circular track THEN the system SHALL show current session time and lap information
2. WHEN drivers have different statuses (pit, out, retired) THEN the system SHALL visually indicate these states
3. WHEN the race leader completes a lap THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of lap completion
4. WHEN timing data is stale or unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate data freshness to the user
